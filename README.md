# Cr24

A Chrome extension.

Trying to learn some Vuejs and Sass basics while writing a useful Chrome extension.
Currently this extension replaces default new tab with a new one that loads very fast.

## Usage

Currently not available in bundled form or in Chrome store.
You'll have to manually install it in developer mode.

Install `Sass` tool and compile `styles/newtab.scss` to `styles/newtab.css` before installing.

## License
See `LICENSE` file for details.
